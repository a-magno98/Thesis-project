# Thesis-project
Java implementation of thesis project regarding bioinformatics scenario using three different databases: Neo4j, JanusGraph, HugeGraph.

In this thesis, starting from a real-world application related to the biological research 
field and based on Neo4j, which is one of the most used graph-based systems, we 
analyze possible alternatives to evaluate, in particular:
1. insertion and retrieval performance
2. data analysis support
3. interoperability via Gremlin, which is a query language product of the 
Apache TinkerPop project

This thesis aims to analyze some existing alternative database systems based on the 
graph model, compare them to Neo4j, and evaluate the pros and cons of a specific 
bioinformatics use case. First, we 
extracted the use case's requirements, made an initial comparison of existing systems 
based on the requirements, and selected two specific systems, JanusGraph and 
HugeGraph. We implemented a graph database in the two systems and Neo4j to 
evaluate the learning curve, usability, and performance.
